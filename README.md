# SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) - Learning Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Learning Repository. This repository contains a collection of SQL queries and concepts that serve as the foundation for mastering database management and manipulation using SSMS. Whether you're new to SQL or refining your skills, this guide will walk you through essential topics and practical examples.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Creating Databases and Tables**
   - **Creating Databases**: Learn how to create a new database in SSMS using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.
   - **Creating Tables**: Understand how to define tables within a database, including the use of different data types and setting primary keys.
   - **Auto-Increment Columns**: Introduction to setting up auto-incrementing columns using the `IDENTITY` property, similar to `AUTO_INCREMENT` in MySQL.

### 2. **Basic SQL Queries**
   - **SELECT Statements**: Learn how to retrieve data from a table using the `SELECT` statement, including selecting specific columns and using `*` to select all columns.
   - **WHERE Clauses**: Apply conditions to your queries to filter results based on specific criteria.
   - **ORDER BY**: Sort the results of your queries in ascending or descending order.

### 3. **Aggregating and Grouping Data**
   - **GROUP BY Clause**: Learn how to group data based on one or more columns and perform aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc.
   - **HAVING Clause**: Apply conditions to grouped data using the `HAVING` clause, filtering the results of aggregate functions.

### 4. **SQL Functions and Calculations**
   - **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic calculations in SQL queries, understanding the precedence of operations similar to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).
   - **String Functions**: Introduction to common string functions such as `LEN()`, `SUBSTRING()`, and `REPLACE()`.

### 5. **Limiting and Paginating Results**
   - **TOP Clause**: Limit the number of rows returned by a query using the `TOP` clause, useful for quick data previews.
   - **OFFSET-FETCH**: Implement pagination by skipping a specified number of rows and fetching the next set of rows. This is particularly useful for working with large datasets.

### 6. **Basic Data Types**
   - **Understanding Data Types**: A guide to the basic data types available in SQL Server, such as `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATETIME`, and `DECIMAL`, and how to use them when defining table columns.

### 7. **Viewing and Managing Tables**
   - **Viewing Tables**: How to list tables in a database using the Object Explorer in SSMS.
   - **Troubleshooting Table Visibility**: Steps to take if tables are not showing in the Object Explorer or are not recognized in queries.

### 8. Common Issues and Troubleshooting
   - **Database Context**: Ensuring that your queries are executed in the correct database context.
   - **IntelliSense Refresh**: How to refresh IntelliSense in SSMS to recognize newly created tables or changes in the database schema.

## Getting Started

To begin working with the examples provided in this repository, ensure you have SQL Server Management Studio installed and a connection to your SQL Server instance. Each SQL script is designed to be run individually in SSMS, with comments provided to guide you through the execution process and expected results.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a foundation for building more complex SQL queries and database management tasks in SSMS. By mastering these basics, you'll be well-equipped to handle more advanced topics in SQL Server and database administration.
